# Chat Feature Implementation PR (v0.4.0)

## Overview
This PR addresses the nuqs adapter configuration error that arose after merging main into the feature branch. The error was related to the URL query state management library (nuqs) requiring proper adapter setup for Next.js 14.2.0+. Additionally, this PR includes various bug fixes and enhancements to the chat feature.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed nuqs Adapter Configuration 
- Identified the error: `[nuqs] nuqs requires an adapter to work with your framework`
- Root cause: nuqs 2.4.1 requires explicit adapter configuration for Next.js 14.2.0+
- Solution implemented:
  1. Removed the old configuration from `next.config.mjs`:
     ```javascript
     /** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
     const nextConfig = {};
     
     export default nextConfig;
     ```
  2. Added the NuqsAdapter in the root layout (`src/app/layout.tsx`):
     ```typescript
     import { NuqsAdapter } from 'nuqs/adapters/next/app';
     
     // ... other imports

     export default function RootLayout({
         children,
     }: Readonly<{
         children: React.ReactNode;
     }>) {
         return (
             <html lang="en" className="h-full">
             <body className={cn(inter.className, "antialiased h-full")}>
                 <QueryProvider>
                     <NuqsAdapter>
                         <Toaster/>
                         <main className="h-full">
                             {children}
                         </main>
                     </NuqsAdapter>
                 </QueryProvider>
             </body>
             </html>
         );
     }
     ```

### 2. Chat Feature Improvements

#### 2.1 Form Reset in Create Conversation Dialog
- Issue: Form state persisted between dialog opens/closes
- Solution:
  ```typescript
  // Reset form when dialog opens or closes
  React.useEffect(() => {
    if (!isOpen) {
      handleReset();
    }
  }, [isOpen]);
  
  // Updated onOpenChange to handle reset
  onOpenChange={(open) => {
    if (!open) {
      handleReset();
      onClose();
    }
  }}
  ```

#### 2.2 Preserve User-Edited Conversation Names
- Issue: Auto-suggested conversation names were overwriting user input
- Solution:
  - Added a `userEditedName` state to track manual edits
  ```typescript
  const [userEditedName, setUserEditedName] = useState(false);
  
  // Custom handler to detect user edits
  const handleNameChange = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    setName(e.target.value);
    setUserEditedName(true);
  };
  
  // Updated auto-suggest effect to respect user edits
  React.useEffect(() => {
    if (userEditedName) return;
    
    // Auto-suggestion logic
  }, [selectedMemberIds, safeAvailableMembers, userEditedName]);
  ```

#### 2.3 Enhanced Avatar Display
- Updated avatar implementation to match workspace styling
- Removed avatar images and used consistent square avatars with initials
- Applied in:
  - Conversation header: Blue background with white initials
  - Message bubbles: Blue for current user, gray for others
  ```tsx
  <Avatar className="border-2 border-white rounded-md">
    <AvatarFallback className="text-white bg-blue-600 font-semibold text-lg uppercase rounded-md">
      {member.name.charAt(0).toUpperCase()}
    </AvatarFallback>
  </Avatar>
  ```

#### 2.4 Fixed "No Members Available" Issue
- Issue: Members existed but were not showing in conversation creation dialog
- Root cause: Overly aggressive filtering of members in `availableMembers`
- Solution:
  - Simplified filtering to only exclude the exact current user
  - Added debugging to trace member data flow
  ```typescript
  // Filter out the current user from available members
  const availableMembers = React.useMemo(() => {
    if (!Array.isArray(members)) return [];
    
    // If we have the current user, only filter out the current user
    if (currentUser) {
      return members.filter(member => {
        // Only filter out exact ID match for current user
        if (currentUser.$id && member.id === currentUser.$id) {
          return false;
        }
        
        return true;
      });
    }
    
    return members;
  }, [members, currentUser]);
  ```

#### 2.5 Fixed Member API Integration
- Improved ID handling in the chat members API
- Added consistent transform of member data
- Enhanced error handling for the members list

#### 2.6 Added DELETE API Support
- Issue: DELETE operations were failing with 405 Method Not Allowed
- Root cause: Missing DELETE handler in the API route
- Solution: Added DELETE export to the API route handlers
  ```typescript
  // src/app/api/[[...route]]/route.ts
  export const GET = handle(app);
  export const POST = handle(app);
  export const PATCH = handle(app);
  export const DELETE = handle(app); // Added DELETE handler
  ```

#### 2.7 Fixed Critical User ID Inconsistency in Chat System
- Issue: Messages were not appearing on receiver's end due to ID mismatch
- Root cause: Inconsistent ID handling between member display and authorization checks
  - UI was using document IDs (`member.$id` or `member.id`)
  - Server auth checks were using user IDs (`user.$id`)
- Solution: Updated member ID mapping to consistently use the user ID
  ```typescript
  // src/features/chat/api/use-get-members.ts
  const members: User[] = data.documents.map((member: any) => {
    // IMPORTANT: Use userId for consistent ID handling
    // This matches the ID used in authorization checks
    const memberId = member.userId || 'unknown-id';
    
    return {
      id: memberId, // Use userId for consistency
      name: member.name || 'Unknown User',
      email: member.email,
      avatar: member.avatar || '',
    };
  });
  ```
- This ensures:
  - The member IDs displayed in conversation creation match server expectations
  - Both sender and receiver have proper access to conversations
  - Authorization checks work correctly across the system

### 3. Testing Steps ✅
